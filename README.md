# Cancer Patients Analytics 🧬

**Healthcare Data Analysis**

This project focuses on analyzing a normalized database of cancer patient records using SQL. It explores patient demographics, diagnosis stages, treatment outcomes, survival rates, and risk factors.

📊 All reporting and visuals for this project were built and published on my website:

## 📌 Key Areas of Analysis

### 1. Patient Demographics

* Age group distribution
* Gender breakdown across cancer stages
* Countries with the highest number of cancer cases
* Average BMI by gender and age group

### 2. Diagnosis & Staging

* Stage distribution at diagnosis
* Trends in new diagnoses over time
* Average diagnosis age per stage
* Countries with high rates of late-stage diagnoses

### 3. Risk Factors

* Smoking status vs cancer stage
* Count of patients with a family history of cancer
* Prevalence of hypertension, asthma, and cirrhosis
* Cholesterol levels by age group and cancer stage

### 4. Treatment Patterns

* Frequency of treatment types
* Average treatment duration by stage
* Common treatments per cancer stage
* Combined vs. single treatment distribution

### 5. Country-Level Insights

* Number of patients per country
* Country-wise survival rates
* Variation of treatment types by country

### 6. Outcomes & Survival

* Overall survival vs death rate
* Survival by cancer stage
* Survival by treatment type
* Impact of smoking, family history, and comorbidities on survival
